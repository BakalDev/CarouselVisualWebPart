# CarouselCommunity

This is a Visual Web Part created for SharePoint 2010 and has been engineered specifically for the Community site, which is an internally facing SharePoint site.

## Features
Five Material Design inspired color palettes which will distinguish news items by type.

# Adapt this Web Part
Follow basic steps to adapt this web part to your needs.

1. Update the Configurables section 
2. Modify NewsItem class to meet your own properties.
3. Modify Page Load method to map properties.
4. Update repeater control.
5. Relink CSS and JS in main web part page.

# Libraries
Powered by a lightweight jQuery library; http://bxslider.com/.

## CSS/JS
The css and js files in the project are not used. They are called from the Site Assets as links. I have just added an instance of them so they are also source controlled.
